D port of nanogui

The port is in very early stage. There are differencies with origin. For example:
- instead of const references passing by value is used
- as a color and vector implementation gfm.math is used (in origin eigen used as a vector implementation and own implementation of color type)
- no locking on glfw, instead Screen class will provide way to subclass it using other backend, now arsd.simpledisplay is used as a backend

Now ported small part of origin to proof the concept. 

Screen (very incomplete) provides way to interact with windowing system (in fact it encapsulate OS window)
Window is abstraction of window specific to nanogui
Widget is the base class
Theme provides way to change appearing like you want
Layout allows to place widget together dynamically change their size and position
Label, Checkbox like Label and Checkbox

No interaction provided yet, it needs to be designed.
