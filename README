D port of nanogui

The port is in very early stage. There is difference with origin. For example:
- instead of const references passing by value is used
- as a color and vector implementation gfm.math is used (in origin eigen used as a vector implementation and own implementation of color type)
- no locking on glfw, instead Screen class will provide way to subclass it using other backend, now arsd.simpledisplay is used as a backend

Examples

Two examples added:
- arsd.simpledisplay based, run it using `dub --config=arsd`
- SDL2 based, run it using `dub --config=sdl`
